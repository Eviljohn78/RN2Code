          <p>
            Hello! My name is John and I am an RN with over 20 years of experience. I have had a long
            and rewarding nursing career, with experience in various specialties such as: critical care,
            management, recovery room, and the operating room. Over the last couple of years, I
            have been feeling the burn-out setting in. This is what has led me here.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have always had an interest in computers. I have been a PC gamer for years. I have built my
            own PC, and enjoy troubleshooting issues when they arise. I have always been curious how
            things work on the software side, so I have decided to learn how to code. I am beginning this 
            journey with basic web development, with a goal of moving on to more complex projects in time. 
            I plan on turning this endeavor into a new career in the future.
