          Hello! My name is John and I am an RN with over 20 years of experience. I have had a long
          and rewarding nursing career, with experience in various specialties such as: critical care,
          nursing management, recovery room, and the operating room. Over the last couple of years, I
          have been feeling the burn-out setting in. This is what has led me here.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always had an interest in computers. I have been a PC gamer for years. I have built my
          own PC, and enjoy troubleshooting issues when they arise. I have always been curious how
          computer programs work on the software side, so I have decided to learn how to code. I am
          beginning this journey with basic web development, with a goal of moving on to more complex
          projects in time. I plan on turning this endeavor into a new career in the future.
        <p>
          This is the website that I will build and update throughout my learning process.
