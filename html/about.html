          <p>
            Hello! My name is John and I grew up in the small coal mining town of Grundy in southwest Virginia. I grew up with many interests, such as fishing, basketball, playing guitar, and video games. I went to Big Rock Elementary School, Grundy High School, and then to Southwest Virginia Community College in Richlands, Virginia.

            I graduated with my degree in Nursing in early 2001, and have been working in the field ever since. I have had a long and rewarding nursing career, with experience in various specialties, such as critical care, management, recovery room, and the operating room. Over the last couple of years, I have been feeling the need for a change. This is what has led me here.

            I have always had an interest in computers. I have been a PC gamer for years and have built my own gaming PC. I have always been curious about how things work on the software side, so I have decided to learn to code. I am beginning this journey with basic web development, with the goal of moving on to more complex projects in time.
