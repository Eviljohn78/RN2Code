            This is the first draft of my website after working with HTML for a few weeks. I feel like<br>
            I've made some good progress in these first few weeks. I have made it through the HTML<br>
            section of <em><q>Head First HTML and CSS</q></em> and Free Code Camp, and will soon begin with the<br>
            CSS sections of both resources. I am looking forward to learning how to add a little style to<br>
            what I've done so far.

            Look for another update sometime next month as I get acquainted with CSS.

            This is where I begin my journey. After many hours of research, I have decided to work my<br>
            way through the book <em><q>Head First HTML and CSS</q></em>. This looks like a good place to start<br>
            since it appears to be very beginner friendly.

            I have also decided to start learning Linux along the way. It seems to be a good choice for<br>
            web development and programming in general, since most servers that house webpages are<br>
            built on it.
