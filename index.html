            Over the last couple of weeks, I have been working with CSS flexbox. I have worked through the flexbox sections of Free Code Camp
            and The Odin Project. I have also watched a lot of videos and read a lot of online tutorials on the subject. I did the flexbox landing 
            page project on The Odin Project. I updated this same project to be a small tribute page to my dog that had recently passed 
            away. It's not much, but I feel it was therapeutic for me.

            After working through these two projects, I decided to update this site again. I only made a few small changes to the layout,
            but it was good to get more practice with flexbox. I decided to remove the background picture that I used for the header and 
            footer since I found that online. I also added some media queries to change the "about" and "links" pages to a column format
            when the page width is less than 800 pixels. The next thing I will be working on will be CSS grid.

            I have really been digging into CSS over the last couple of weeks and I am finding it really interesting.
            I know I have just barely scratched the surface, but I am amazed at how much of a difference even a little CSS
            makes on a webpage. I finished <em><q>Head First HTML and CSS</q></em> last week, and have been working through
            the CSS sections of both Free Code Camp and The Odin Project this week. I am adding screenshots to each update to 
            keep track of how far I've come with this site.

            I have also been working my way through the book <em><q>Learn Linux Quickly</q></em>, when I feel like I need a little
            break from the coding. I installed WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux) and have been using Visual Studio Code as my text editor. 
            I really like having WSL installed on my PC, because this allows me to get used to using linux commands in the terminal.
            I have been able to use the git commands in this terminal to clone repositories from github, and also to add, commit, and push
            updates to my own repositories.

            This is the first draft of my website after working with HTML for a few weeks. I feel like
            I've made some good progress in these first few weeks. I have made it through the HTML
            section of <em><q>Head First HTML and CSS</q></em> and Free Code Camp, and will soon begin with the
            CSS sections of both resources. I am looking forward to learning how to add a little style to
            what I've done so far.

            Look for another update sometime next month as I get acquainted with CSS.

            This is where I begin my journey. After many hours of research, I have decided to work my
            way through the book <em><q>Head First HTML and CSS</q></em>. This looks like a good place to start
            since it appears to be very beginner friendly.

            I have also decided to start learning Linux along the way. It seems to be a good choice for
            web development and programming in general, since most servers that house webpages are
            built on it.
